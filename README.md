Ball game demo

My game will be control the ball to go up, down, left, right, and jump with space. And it has a Miku (Virtual singer) background and after the player 
eats all the pick ups, the game will play the music. Also, when the player eat the pick up, it will create a sound. 
I did change Anthony's game: mainly add the picture into the game.
Also change Salem's game: add picture(photoshop), make so that player can jump by space, play a start music, set a trap that if player do not eat
one of the pick up, it would lock the player inside a box and can not move anymore.
